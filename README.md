# On the Existence of Billionaires: An Apolitical Analysis

## Objectives  
- Analyze the positive economic impact of billionaires, including job creation, innovation, and philanthropy.  
- Investigate the potential costs of wealth concentration for the average citizen.  
- Compare the economic benefits provided by billionaires to the potential costs, such as reduced social mobility and any decrease to the average quality of life.
