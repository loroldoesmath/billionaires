# On the Existence of Billionaires: An Apolitical Analysis  

This project explores the existence of billionaires through an apolitical lens, focusing on the balance between the economic costs and benefits of consolidated wealth. The primary motivating question is:  

**Does the cost of consolidated wealth outweigh the economic benefit provided by billionaires?**

## Objectives  
- Analyze the positive economic impact of billionaires, including job creation, innovation, and philanthropy.  
- Investigate the potential costs of wealth concentration for the average citizen.  
- Compare the economic benefits provided by billionaires to the potential costs, such as reduced social mobility and any decrease to the average quality of life.  

## Scope  
This project is purely analytical and does not advocate for or against any policies, ideologies, or systems. The goal is to present objective findings based on data and evidence.
